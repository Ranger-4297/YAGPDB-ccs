# Leveling reward

> Note
> You must disable or replace your old Message handler and Role Rewards ccs

# Info
- Provides a *small* compatibility layer with the [leveling system](https://yagpdb-cc.github.io/leveling/overview) on the [YAGPDB CC Github](https://yagpdb-cc.github.io/)
- Allows moderators to assign a **cash** value at the end of `-role-rewards add` to be added to a users balance upon hitting a role reward

I am not walking you through the set up for that as they aren't my commands. Sorry.#]
